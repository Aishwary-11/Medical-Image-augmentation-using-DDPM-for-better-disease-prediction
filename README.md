# Medical-Image-augmentation-using-DDPM-for-better-disease-prediction
This project uses Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to generate synthetic medical images for augmenting limited datasets. DDPM learns to create realistic images by reversing a noise process, helping overcome data scarcity in medical imaging.
